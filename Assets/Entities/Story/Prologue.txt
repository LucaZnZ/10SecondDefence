Hello, and welcome to the world of Itmartashia! We wish we could welcome you under better circumstances but we’re in a bit of a kill-or-be-killed situation. We know you must be somewhat confused, considering we summoned you from another world but we’re pressed for time as is and no, you’re not dreaming! My name is Queen Xolonia and we’re currently in the kingdom of Frasia. The vile Emperor Muerte has conquered all the nations surrounding us and we are the last line of defense against his world domination. If we fail here, he succeeds in oppressing this world’s people.
We were able to summon you with our ancient relic that has been handed down for generations only to be used in a dire situation. I’ve only heard stories of the relic and its power. But from what my late father told me, it should have given you the power to create and commands troops and objects to halt their advances along with time manipulation. As we didn’t have enough mana stones for a complete ritual your time manipulation ability should only manifest and shine its brightest at around 10 seconds. Please, hero, I know this is a lot to spring on you at once but please, save us from our fate.

The vile Emperor Muerte has been slain thanks to your tactical prowess! The other kingdoms have already begun to secede from his empire and restore their autonomy. The other kingdoms have democratically instilled a new title of ‘High Queen’ with Queen Xolonia filling the role. She vowed to never let anything similar to the vile Emperor Muerte happen again. She hadn’t forgotten your role in saving their world. She gave you the option to return to your world or to stay and join her royal court, appointed as her right-hand man and retain the role as Knight-Commander. The decision is yours, what do you want to do?

# 10SecondDefence
 A tower defence game created for the Ludum Dare 51 Game Jam

# Controls:
- WASD -> Move camera around the map
- Space/Shift/Mousewheel -> move camera up and down
- ESC -> Close detail window
- Left Mouseclick:
- click on units, then on terrain to move them
- click on terrain and units for information

# How to play:
- The **blue time** in the Top is your **currency and the spawn in time for the next wave**.
- **Using all energy will kill you!**
- Try staying as **close to 10s** as you can, **you will do more damage**. Attack Range and Speed are important.
- You **get more time** for defeating all enemies in a wave.
- Units can't move for a while, after attacking. This depends on their attackspeed.
- Trust me, there are minibosses, a final boss and a way to victory. You just have to survive long enough...
- The game might not be perfectly balanced yet... good luck
